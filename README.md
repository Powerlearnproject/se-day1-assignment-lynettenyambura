#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software. 
The goal of software engineering is to produce reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions that meet the needs of users while maintaining a high standard of quality.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, and constraints. It includes feasibility studies and the creation of project plans.

Requirements Analysis: In this phase, developers gather and analyze the software requirements from stakeholders. This includes functional and non-functional requirements.

Design: The design phase involves creating architectural designs and detailed designs that specify how the software will be structured and how components will interact.

Implementation (Coding): During this phase, the actual code is written according to the design specifications. This is the development phase where the software is created.

Testing: After coding, the software is thoroughly tested to identify and fix bugs. Testing ensures that the software meets the specified requirements.

Deployment: Once the software passes all tests, it is deployed to the production environment where it can be used by end-users.

Maintenance: Post-deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated and improved based on user feedback and changing requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
 Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as regulatory compliance software.
 Agile Methodology: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach where development occurs in cycles (sprints), allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation.
 Agile is ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, such as startups developing a new product.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:
Role: Responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code.
Responsibilities:
Implementing software solutions based on design specifications.
Debugging and resolving issues.
Collaborating with other team members to ensure code quality.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Role: Ensures that the software meets quality standards before it is released.
Responsibilities:
Creating and executing test plans.
Identifying and documenting bugs.
Verifying that software meets all requirements and is free of defects.

Project Manager:
Role: Oversees the project from start to finish, ensuring that it meets deadlines, stays within budget, and achieves its objectives.
Responsibilities:
Planning and defining project scope.
Coordinating team activities and resources.
Managing risks and ensuring successful project delivery.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and Fixing Bugs : Identifying and fixing bugs, especially in large or complex codebases, can be time-consuming and frustrating.
Systematic Approach: Use debugging tools to trace the execution flow and identify the source of the problem. Test each part of the code systematically to isolate the issue.
Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews with peers to catch potential bugs early.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit Testing: Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation to ensure they work correctly.It ensures that each part of the code functions as expected.
 Integration Testing: involves testing the interaction between different modules or components to ensure they work together as expected. It Identifies issues that arise when different parts of the system are combined.
 System testing involves testing the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.It Validates the overall functionality, performance, and security of the application.
 Acceptance testing involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the user or clientâ€™s requirements and is ready for deployment. Ensures that the software delivers value to the user and meets their needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and refining input prompts to effectively interact with AI models, particularly language models like GPT. Ensure that the AI provides accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What can AI do? - vague
What are the key applications of AI in healthcare, and how does it improve patient outcomes? -improved
The improved prompt is targeted and specific. It narrows down the topic to AI's role in healthcare and asks for an explanation of how it benefits patient outcomes.
